        <p>Peel the potatoes and cook until al dente. Remove all the pulp from the oranges and cut the peels into thin strips. Boil the peels in a pan for five minutes and strain them.Repeat the process 3 times to remove the bitterness from the peel. But keep the water from boiling and reserve the shells. </p>

In a pan with a little oil, seal all sides of the duck.Remove the duck and oil from the pan, placing the boiling water of the orange with the sugar in the pan. Add the vinegar and stir until thick. Add the juice of 3 oranges and the broth.</p>
        
		<p>Return the duck to the pan, drizzle it with the sauce in the pan and cook for two hours, always basting it every 10 minutes. After cooking, squeeze another orange and lemon into the pan and place the potatoes, orange peels and season with parsley on top.</p>
